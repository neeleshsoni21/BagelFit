# BagelFit
Fitting Torus Structures to Nuclear Membrane Density Maps.  

BagelFit is a computational tool designed to fit toroidal structures onto nuclear membrane density maps using efficient search algorithms. Built for precision and scalability, it leverages integrative modeling techniques to optimize torus parameters and analyze nuclear morphology.


Features:

âœ… Torus fitting with binary & non-binary density maps
âœ… Cross-correlation-based optimization
âœ… Dice coefficient calculation for overlap analysis
âœ… Visualization of voxel intensity distributions
âœ… Support for nuclear membrane structural studies

Whether youâ€™re studying nuclear organization or just love bagels, BagelFit brings toroidal fitting to the next level! ðŸ¥¯âœ¨
